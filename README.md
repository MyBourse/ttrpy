ttrpy is a Python package that provides popular technical analysis function for
financial time series data.

Indicators represent a statistical approach to technical analysis. By looking at
money flow, trends, volatility, and momentum, they provide a secondary measure
to actual price movements and help confirm the quality of chart patterns or form
buy or sell signals

1. Leading Indicators: precede price movements and try to predict the future. These indicators are most helpful during periods of sideways or non-trending price movements since they can help identify breakouts or breakdowns.

2. Lagging Indicators: follow price movements and act as a confirmation tool. These indicators are most useful during trending periods where they can be used to confirm that a trend is still in place or if it is weakening.

Different types of indicators

1. Trend indicators measure the direction and strength of a trend by comparing prices to an established baseline.

2. Momentum indicators may identify the speed of price movement by comparing the current closing price to previous closes.

3. Volatility indicators measure the rate of price movement, regardless of direction.

4. Volume indicators measure the strength of a trend based on volume of shares traded.
